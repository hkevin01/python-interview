# Improvement Prompt for Python Interview Assistant

I have a PyQt-based Python interview application that needs significant improvements. Please help me enhance it with the following requirements:

## 1. Enhanced Questions Database
Create a comprehensive questions.json file with:
- **150+ questions** across beginner (50), intermediate (60), advanced (40) levels
- **Real interview questions** from top tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.)
- **Code-heavy questions** with practical coding challenges
- **Modern Python topics**: asyncio, type hints, dataclasses, f-strings, walrus operator, etc.
- **Framework-specific questions**: Django, Flask, FastAPI, pandas, numpy, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **System design questions** for senior roles
- **Each question should include**:
  - Clear question text
  - Detailed answer with explanation
  - Code examples (when applicable)
  - Alternative solutions
  - Time/space complexity analysis
  - Common mistakes to avoid
  - Follow-up questions

## 2. Code Syntax Highlighting
Implement syntax highlighting for code blocks in answers:
- Use **Pygments** library for Python syntax highlighting
- Create a custom widget that renders code with colors
- Support multiple themes (dark mode, light mode)
- Line numbers for longer code examples
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for code blocks

## 3. Enhanced GUI Features
Improve the PyQt interface with:
- **Modern UI design** with better typography and spacing
- **Code viewer widget** with syntax highlighting
- **Progress tracking** showing mastery level for each topic
- **Bookmark system** with categories
- **Search functionality** with filters (difficulty, topic, keywords)
- **Quiz mode** with timer and scoring
- **Study path recommendations** based on user progress
- **Dark/Light theme toggle**
- **Export functionality** (save questions as PDF/HTML)

## 4. Sample Question Format
Each question should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "question": "Question text here",
  "answer": "Detailed answer with explanation",
  "code_example": "# Python code here\nprint('Hello World')",
  "alternative_solutions": ["solution1", "solution2"],
  "complexity": {"time": "O(n)", "space": "O(1)"},
  "category": "data_structures",
  "subcategory": "lists",
  "difficulty": "beginner",
  "companies": ["Google", "Amazon"],
  "follow_up": "What if we needed to...",
  "common_mistakes": ["mistake1", "mistake2"],
  "related_topics": ["topic1", "topic2"]
}
```

## 5. Advanced Features to Add
- **Adaptive learning**: Adjust question difficulty based on user performance
- **Spaced repetition**: Show questions again based on forgetting curve
- **Mock interview mode**: Timed sessions with realistic interview flow
- **Performance analytics**: Track weak areas and improvement over time
- **Collaborative features**: Share custom question sets
- **Voice integration**: Read questions aloud, voice answers
- **Code execution**: Run Python code examples in embedded interpreter
- **Video explanations**: Integrate video tutorials for complex topics

## 6. Specific Topics to Cover
Include comprehensive coverage of:

**Core Python**: Variables, data types, control structures, functions, classes, modules, exceptions, file I/O, decorators, generators, context managers, metaclasses

**Data Structures & Algorithms**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion

**Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstract classes, multiple inheritance, method resolution order

**Advanced Python**: Asyncio, threading, multiprocessing, memory management, garbage collection, GIL, descriptors, slots, weakref

**Popular Libraries**: 
- **Data Science**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, keras
- **Web Frameworks**: Django, Flask, FastAPI, requests
- **Testing**: pytest, unittest, mock
- **Others**: SQLAlchemy, celery, redis

**System Design**: Database design, API design, caching, scalability, microservices, deployment

## 7. Code Highlighting Implementation
Create a custom QTextEdit widget with:
```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QTextEdit
from PyQt5.QtGui import QSyntaxHighlighter, QTextCharFormat, QFont
from PyQt5.QtCore import QRegExp, Qt
import pygments
from pygments.lexers import PythonLexer
from pygments.formatters import get_formatter_by_name

class CodeHighlighter(QSyntaxHighlighter):
    # Implementation for syntax highlighting
    pass

class CodeViewer(QTextEdit):
    # Custom widget for displaying code with highlighting
    pass
```

## 8. Sample Enhanced Questions
Provide examples like:

**Beginner Example**:
```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between `==` and `is` operators in Python?",
  "answer": "The `==` operator compares values for equality, while `is` compares object identity (memory location).",
  "code_example": "a = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [1, 2, 3]\nc = a\n\nprint(a == b)  # True - same values\nprint(a is b)  # False - different objects\nprint(a is c)  # True - same object",
  "explanation": "This distinction is crucial for understanding Python's object model..."
}
```

**Advanced Example**:
```json
{
  "question": "Implement a decorator that limits function execution time",
  "answer": "Use threading and signals to create a timeout decorator",
  "code_example": "import functools\nimport signal\n\ndef timeout(seconds):\n    def decorator(func):\n        @functools.wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            # Implementation here\n            pass\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator"
}
```

## 9. Additional Features
- **Export study notes** in markdown format
- **Integration with coding platforms** (LeetCode, HackerRank)
- **Custom question creation** interface
- **Study group features** for collaborative learning
- **Achievement system** with badges and milestones
- **Offline mode** with full functionality
- **Multiple languages support** for questions/UI

## Implementation Priority:
1. Enhanced questions database (immediate impact)
2. Code syntax highlighting (visual improvement)
3. Better UI/UX (user engagement)
4. Advanced features (long-term value)

Please provide:
1. Complete implementation code for the syntax highlighting system
2. Sample of 20 high-quality questions for each difficulty level
3. Updated GUI components with modern design
4. Database schema improvements
5. Performance optimizations for large question sets

Focus on making this a professional-grade interview preparation tool that stands out from existing solutions.
